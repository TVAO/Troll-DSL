# Troll-DSL

Troll DSL for specifying die-rolls implemented in PLD LISP.

Please refer to `docs` for a description of the Troll language, the PLD LISP host language (variant of Lisp), and a solution of the Troll DSL with examples.

These documents also explain how to run PLD LISP, and the embedded Troll DSL. 

The Troll DSL implementation is contained in `src/troll.le`.
