# Troll-DSL
Troll DSL for specifying die-rolls implemented in PLD LISP.
Refer to `docs` for a description of the Troll language, the PLD LISP host language (variant of Lisp), and a solution of the Troll DSL with examples.
These documents also explain how to run PLD LISP, and the embedded Troll DSL. 
Refer to `src/troll.le` for the Troll DSL implementation.
