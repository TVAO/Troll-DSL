# Troll-DSL

Troll DSL for specifying die-rolls implemented in PLD LISP.

Please refer to `docs` for a description of the Troll language, the PLD LISP host language, and the solution.

These documents explain the language semantics, how to run PLD LISP, and demonstrate examples in the embedded Troll DSL. 

The actual Troll DSL implementation is contained in `src/troll.le`.
