# Troll-DSL

Troll DSL for specifying die-rolls implemented in PLD LISP.

Please refer to `docs` for a description of the Troll language, the PLD LISP host language, and the solution.

These documents explain the Troll DSL semantics, and how to run it in PLD LISP with examples. 

The actual Troll DSL implementation is contained in `src/troll.le`.
